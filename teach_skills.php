        <h4> 
            University Teaching is an introductory course in teaching and learning in tertiary education, designed by staff at the Centre for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning at the University of Hong Kong. <br>
            <br>
            With input from instructors, guests and interviewees, including teaching award winners, students, and experts in the fields, you will be exposed to research evidence in relation to effective university teaching and practical instructional design strategies.  You will also be exposed to multiple examples of effective teaching, and hear the views of teachers whose teaching has been judged to be excellent.<br>
            More specifically, University Teaching will help you to address the following questions:<br>
            - What does teaching in higher education involve? <br>
            - What does research evidence tell us about effective teaching in higher education? <br>
            - How can we ensure that our instructional design will help our students achieve their intended learning outcomes? <br>
            - What pedagogic options do we have to make our teaching successful? <br>
            - What assessment and feedback practices can help our students learn more effectively?<br> 
            <br>
            After completing the learning tasks in this course, you will be able to:<br>
            - Discuss the teaching and learning context in higher education and reflect on the potential
            challenges and opportunities you might encounter.<br>
            - Explain key teaching and learning concepts and relevant evidence in relation to effective university teaching.<br>
            - Analyse the relationships between various aspects of teaching and student learning.<br>
            - Identify a range of instructional strategies to support effective student learning.<br>
            - Apply key concepts to the structuring of course outlines and lesson plans in order to create learning experiences to support successful student learning.<br><br>

       <h4> 
            Where to start to innovate your teaching? But before that, what does it mean to innovate in the classroom? Designing Learning Innovation aims to put the designing culture at the service of learning innovation, supporting those who do not have a specific pedagogical background and those who wish to learn the basic tools of a good teaching design then to continue exploring the frontiers of innovation.
            <br><br>
            A set of logical and methodological tools to innovate teaching, finding the most suitable approaches with one’s own vision of the teaching-learning experience.
            <br>
            <b>INTENDED LEARNING OUTCOMES (ILOs)</b> <br>

            If you actively participate in this course, at the end you will be able to:<br>
            - Use basic theoretical-methodological tools (such as Constructive Alignment and the Learning Innovation Network) to enhance teaching coherence between learning objectives, assessment methods and learning experiences.<br>
            - Apply pedagogical frameworks of the active learning methodology to the design either an individual teaching module or an entire teaching path.<br>
            - Evaluate advantages and disadvantages, in the field of your own teachings, of traditional evaluation approaches compared to the new assessment strategies, in particular those oriented to the formative evaluation.<br>
            - Apply simple strategies for managing the active class in small, medium and large classrooms;
            designing and producing quality teaching materials also enhancing the availability of “Open Educational Resources”.
            <br>
            THE MOOC-BOOK: MATERIALS AND ACTIVITIES
            The MOOC is realized in a strongly integrated way with the book "Designing Learning Innovation" that will soon be published by Pearson (the english version will be the translation of the italian one already published).
            <br>
            In the course you will find video lessons and infographic articulated as in the book. You will also encounter different types of activities  which will contribute to make your experience richer and more complete.<br><br>

        <h2>E-Learning Ecologies: Innovative Approaches to   <span id="ele">Teaching and Learning for the Digital Age</span> </h2>

        <h4> 
         For three decades and longer we have heard educators and technologists making a case for the transformative power of technology in learning. However, despite the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing.<br>

         If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.
        <br>
        <b>But what might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?</b>
        <br>
        • This course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning – transformative, 21st century learning:
        <br>Ubiquitous Learning, Active Knowledge Making, Multimodal Meaning, Recursive Feedback, Collaborative Intelligence, Metacognition, Differentiated Learning<br> 

        • These affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees, demonstrate these affordances in action. <br><br>

        • This course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the "learning society," including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part "educative." <br><br>

        This course is based on the following book:
         
        <a style="text-decoration: none; color: darkgreen;" href="https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Ecologies-Bill-Cope/dp/1138193720"> <u>Learning-Ecologies-Bill-Cope </u>
        </a>     
        <br> 

        Additional online resources are available
        <a style="text-decoration: none; color: darkgreen;" href="https://newlearningonline.com/e-learning"> <u> Here </u>
        </a>     
        <br>

        This course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the e-Learning Ecologies course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the Learning Design and Leadership Program in the College of Education at the University of Illinois. <br>
        Of course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions. Some people say that these limited kinds of participation offer evidence that MOOCs suffer from low retention rates. Far from it – we say that any level of engagement is good engagement.<br>

       <p>UNSW Sydney (The University of New South Wales)</p>
       <h4> 
        Are you an educator? Have you ever wanted to understand more about how to design your class to make better use of educational technology – whether fully online or in blended contexts? Would you like to learn from those who have extensive practical experience with online technologies?
          <br>
         The Learning to Teach Online (LTTO) MOOC will help you develop a working understanding of successful online teaching strategies that you can apply in your own practice.<br> The course is based upon the multi award winning open educational resource developed by Dr Simon McIntyre and Karin Watson.<br>

         Integrating online technologies into your teaching can be a challenging prospect, and it can be difficult to know how to approach it effectively for the benefit of both students and yourself. No one knows your own content and teaching strengths better than you, and the “one size fits all” formula doesn’t always suit everyone. No matter what type of technology you are interested in exploring or your level of experience, this course will help you draw on your teaching strengths and find the approach that is right for you, your students and your educational context. <br>

        This course will guide you through your journey of understanding how online technologies can enhance your course design. You will have the opportunity to develop your understanding of effective online teaching practices and their relationship to the use of different technologies. You will also be encouraged to progressively design and reflect upon your own online learning activity, assessment or resource for use in your own class if you choose to undertake the course assignments.
